Two Pointers DSA Patterns
This markdown sheet summarizes the key patterns of the Two Pointers technique in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), based on solving 117 publicly available problems. Two Pointers is a popular approach in technical interviews, often applied to arrays, linked lists, and strings. The patterns are categorized into four major types, with subcategories and example problems (marked with *). Start with the example problems to grasp the core ideas, then apply them to others. Solutions can be found in problem discussion pages on platforms like LeetCode.

1. Running from Both Ends of an Array
In this pattern, two pointers start at the left and right ends of an array and move toward the center while performing operations.
2 Sum Problem
Problems involve finding pairs or subsequences that satisfy a sum condition.
